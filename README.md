# StackImpact Go Agent

## Overview

StackImpact is a performance profiling and monitoring service for production Go applications. It gives you continuous visibility with line-of-code precision into application performance, such as CPU, memory and I/O hot spots as well execution bottlenecks, allowing to optimize applications and troubleshoot issues before they impact customers. Learn more at [stackimpact.com](https://stackimpact.com/).



#### Features

* Automatic hot spot profiling for CPU, memory allocations, network, system calls and lock contention.
* Automatic bottleneck tracing for HTTP handlers and HTTP clients.
* Error and panic monitoring.
* Health monitoring including CPU, memory, garbage collection and other runtime metrics.
* Alerts on hot spot anomalies.
* Multiple account users for team collaboration.

#### Documentation

See full [documentation](https://stackimpact.com/docs/) for reference.



## Requirements

Linux, OS X or Windows. Go version 1.5+.


## Getting started


#### Create StackImpact account

Sign up for a free account at [stackimpact.com](https://stackimpact.com/).


#### Installing the agent

Install the Go agent by running

```
go get github.com/auto-profile/stackimpact-go
```

And import the package `github.com/auto-profile/stackimpact-go` in your application.


#### Configuring the agent

Start the agent by specifying agent key and application name. The agent key can be found in your account's Configuration section.

```go
agent := stackimpact.NewAgent();
agent.Start(stackimpact.Options{
    AgentKey: "agent key here",
    AppName: "MyGoApp",
})
```

Other initialization options:
* `AppVersion` (Optional) Sets application version, which can be used to associate profiling information with the source code release.
* `AppEnvironment` (Optional) Used to differentiate applications in different environments.
* `HostName` (Optional) By default host name will be the OS hostname.
* `Debug` (Optional) Enables debug logging.
* `DashboardAddress` (Optional) Used by on-premises deployments only.


Example:

```go
package main

import (
  	"fmt"
  	"net/http"

  	"github.com/auto-profile/stackimpact-go"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello world!")
}

func main() {
  	agent := stackimpact.NewAgent()
    agent.Start(stackimpact.Options{
        AgentKey: "agent key here",
        AppName: "Basic Go Server",
        AppVersion: "1.0.0",
        AppEnvironment: "production",
    })

    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```


#### Measuring code segments (optional)

To measure performance and detect bottlenecks in arbitrary parts of application, the segment API can be used.

```go
segment := agent.MeasureSegment("Segment1")
defer segment.Stop()
```

```go
subsegment := agent.MeasureSubsegment("Segment1", "Subsegment1")
defer subsegment.Stop()
```


#### Monitoring errors (optional)

To monitor exceptions and panics with stack traces, the error recording API can be used.

Recording handled errors:

```go
agent.RecordError(someError)
```

Recording panics without recovering:

```go
defer agent.RecordPanic()
```

Recording and recovering from panics:

```go
defer agent.RecordAndRecoverPanic()
```


#### Analyzing performance data in the Dashboard

Once your application is restarted, start observing regular and anomaly-triggered CPU, memory, IO, and other hot spot profiles, execution bottlenecks as well as process metrics in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stackimpact.com/).


#### Troubleshooting

To enable debug logging, add `Debug: true` to startup options. If debug log doesn't give you any hints on how to fix a problem, please report it to our support team in your account's Support section.


## Overhead

Reporting CPU, network and system profiles requires regular and anomaly-triggered profiling and tracing activation for short periods of time. Unlike memory profiling and process-level metric reporting, they produce some overhead when active. The agent makes sure the profiling is active not more than 5% of the time and, while active, the overhead stays very low and has no effect on application execution.
